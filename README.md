# DailyPlanner
This is a daily planner that can be used to track your day to day activities.

This was a great assignment.  I got to learn so much about lot of things I didn't understand.  One of the things that I learned about was localStorage.  Another thing I learned about was manipulating elements using only jQuery.  Still not a huge fan but I did learn alot.  

Thank you to Lada, John and Mykol for all of your help.  I really thought I was going to lose my mind with this assignment.  Greatly appreciated all of the help you guys gave me.  It was greatly appreciated!!!!!!

So this planner has a few neat features to it.  When you load or refresh the page, depending on the hour, the entries will be different colors.  Grey means the time in the past, red is the current hour and green means in the future.  

There is a save button for each entery that has to be pressed in order to save the entry in it's time block but once it is saved until you save again, the text will stay there even if you refresh the page.

I also added a Reset Local Storage button to aid you guys for grading purposes.  Hope it helps.
